			<h1> Data Brokers </h1>
			<h2> The third party companies you never knew exsisted </h2>

			<time> Who are they?  </time>
			<p>

				Sharing your data online is typically seen as a two-way transaction between the user giving the data and a recipient receiving data; An example of this would be someone creating an account for a social media platform such as Facebook. The user willingly gives vital information such as first/last name, date of birth, hobbies, and interests, in order to create an accurate profile. This seamless and harmless transaction is being eavesdropped by 3rd party data companies, which is a catch term for Data Brokers. Data Brokers are tasked with collecting online data that ranges across all online platforms (email, public records, etc). The data they collect includes information about first/last names, addresses, income, shopping habits, and much more. With the information they gather from across the internet, Data Brokers create a virtual online profile of an individual. They then sell these profiles to advertisers, social media sites, credit agencies, insurers, law enforcement, other data companies, and many more. Data Brokers have been around for a long time, and essentially everyone in the United States is included in at least 1 Database. Acxiom, one of the leading data collection companies, says it has information on 500 million people worldwide, including nearly "every US Citizen" (source). It is a very lucrative business as well. Acxiom was able to clear 800 million dollars in yearly revenue. Data Brokers are the unseen eyes of the virtual world, watching and collecting every little piece of information we leave behind on the internet.

			<time> How do they do it? Too what extend can they share my data?  </time>
			<p>
				How do they extract our data right from under our nose? They collect our data from a variety of sources, many that you never knew were selling your data. One of the primary comes from the state itself. The companies, such as Experian, cite information from the United State Census Bureau and the phone book. The most used methods is embedding lines of code (using cookies and pixels) into millions of websites that identify the user once they click on a website, which triggers their browsing history to get recorded. Companies mainly use the browsing history for target advertising and to create an online profile of your interests (health, political views, social interactions, etc.). It is not only limited to the things we buy; in the 2012 election companies were able to match your voting records with the cookies on your computer, allowing candidates to target you with specific ads (Republican or Democrat). The second most used method comes from E-mail tracking. This may seem impossible, but all it takes is one line of code. It works by embedding a line of code into the body of the email, a 1x1 pixel image - barely visible even to the most avid internet users. With this tracker, companies know whether the email was opened, when it was opened, and where it was opened. Newsletter services have been doing this for years. The shops and other services you use online are also one of the biggest perpetrators in the data sharing market. By accepting the privacy policies of the website you are giving consent that your data will be sold to "trusted" third parties; data companies. Companies are often very vague regarding who they give your data to. There are very few laws and regulations regarding the process, however, there are still some records they do not have access too. They cannot have access to your medical records or conversation history with a doctor. Furthermore they can not use information that determines your creditworthiness, or eligibility for employment/housing. They also do not monitor what you post on social media and who you are friends with. They are interested in statistical information that can benefit an economic or political sector. Regardless of these few regulations, companies can still know what type of health you are in based on your search history. If you search up an allergy that you suffer from, companies like Acxiom sells data on whether the person has a "likelihood" of buying a medical prescription for their allergy. Almost anything on the internet and in public records is essentially fair game for data brokers to record and sell to other companies, raising the question of how do we keep our data safe while on the internet?

	<time> How does this effect me? Can I prevent it? </time>

		The main way that this affects you is through the use of target advertising. When you go on <a href= "http://www.nike.com"> Nike.com </a> to look up a pair of shoes, but do not end up buying them, there is a high likelihood that on the next few websites you visit, there will be targeted ads for the same shoe. This is not limited only to commercial goods. Services that best fit your online profile ‘interests’ will also be advertised directly towards you. This direct form of advertising can make you feel uncomfortably vulnerable while online. How can we prevent this from happening? Some companies allow you to have the option to "opt-out"; however, this task is extremely tedious and extremely hard to complete. In order to opt-out effectively you have to have to know all the different data brokers and find their opt-out agreements, which the majority of consumers do not know how to access. Some data companies do not even offer opt-out agreements, that fact combined with the hundreds of other data brokers that exist makes it seem near impossible to keep your data clean off every database.

	<time> Overall message  <time>


		<p>
			Data brokers are tasked with collecting the trail of data we leave on a variety of online platforms, which creates virtual profiles which are sold to companies for a variety of reasons from financial to political. They are the unseen eyes of the online world that track all the data we willingly and unwillingly reveal. Being aware of this third-party presence we can better protect ourselves from our data being included in online databases. As we are more aware we protect our information with more care and become less likely to relay personal information to these data companies. But all in all the best way to feel more secure online is by reading user agreements and their policies involving data sharing; it is the only way you can truly be sure that your information is in the hands of only the people you want it to be in the hands of. With this information, you are now better prepared to navigate the internet, knowing that there is a 3rd eye watching you online.
